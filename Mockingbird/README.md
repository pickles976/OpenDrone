Mockingbird is intended to be the cheapest and simplest drone to make. It has an initial setup cost of about $250 (not including tools), but the unit cost is about $90. Most of that is the electronics.

Every component is designed to fit on the printing plate of a Bambu A1 mini. The design is intended to be slow-flying and stable, with glider-like performance characteristics. The wings can be constructed out of a single piece of 20"x30" 5mm thick foamboard. The design supports multiple receivers and batteries, with variable wing positioning to adjust the center of gravity accordingly.

# Wing Specs

- Armin Wing Design
- 2 parts, 10" x 30" foamboard
- assembled dimensions
    - chord: 0.15m
    - wingspan: 1.524m
    - area: 0.2286m^2
- aspect ratio: 10.15 (wingspan squared over wing area)
- taper ratio: 1

An aspect ratio of 10 just barely puts us into glider territory. The wing design is a modified [Armin wing design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=karr67ZYho4) tweaked to take up exactly one sheet of 20"x30" foamboard.

### Equations
```math
Aspect Ratio = \frac SA
```

```math
\begin{aligned}
Wing Loading = \frac WA \\
Wing Loading = \frac 12 \rho V_{stall}^2 C_{Lift Max}  \\
V_{stall} = \sqrt{\frac {2\frac WA} {\rho C_{Lift Max}}} \\

\rho = 1.225 \\
C_{Lift Max} = 1.5

\end{aligned}
```

Target weight is 650g, which would give us a stall speed of ~5mph.
