# TODO

- [ ] Finish 3D CAD design and printing profiles
- [ ] Clean up and finalize templates
- [ ] Full step-by-step assembly guide
- [ ] Film full step-by-step guide

## 3D CAD

Wing screw-in hole spacing: 40mm long, 30mm wide

### Design Improvement

**SUNDAY**
- [x] print wing top support thing
- [x] move servo down 5mm
- [ ] redesign wing clamp and get it working
    - [ ] figure out what angle is required
    - [ ] print
    - [ ] attach

- [ ] figure out how to print LW-PLA successfully

#### Case
- [ ] design some kind of locking mechanism for the pod case
- [ ] top case
- [ ] bottom case

- [ ] front case
- [ ] rear case

# PROTOTYPE FINISHED!

# Pre-Release Cleanup

### Template Updates
- [ ] update wing CAD file
    - [ ] remove material from center of wings, make hole for servo cables smaller
    - [ ] attach fairing 14" down wing, 5mm away from leading edge
    - [ ] 7" piano wire length, 70mm actuation distance
    - [ ] 10x20mm hole in the wing next to the fairing
    - [ ] add annotations to wing drawing

- [ ] update all templates with control surface locations and other things
- [ ] combine all templates into printable pdfs
    - [ ] wings
    - [ ] horizontal stabilizer
    - [ ] vertical stabilizer
    - [ ] wing spars

### Make a New one and give it away
- [ ] design cutting jigs

Questions:
- how long did it take to make?
- how many materials did it require?

### Create .3mf files
- [ ] PLA
- [ ] PETG
- [ ] LW-PLA

### Fly It
- [ ] get images of it flying
- [ ] export to 3D model for viewing in browser
- [ ] create a website

### Create Step-By-Step construction guide
- [ ] markdown with images
- [ ] video

### Engineering Docs
- [ ] interface control document
- [ ] power budget
- [ ] mass growth allowance
- [ ] TRL assessment
- [ ] iterate
