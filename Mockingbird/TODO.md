# TODO

### CAD

#### Design Improvement

- [ ] print new cantilevered pod
- [ ] what improvements can be made to cantilevered pod?    
    - [ ] remove CF tube from front half
    - [ ] remove wing mounts from front half
    - [ ] remove dead space between CF rail and wing mount rail
    - [ ] add support rail for the front half which can accept a receiver mount
    - [ ] add integrated strap loop for battery mounting


- [ ] design mount for betaFPV ELRS mini
- [ ] design mount for ESC

- [ ] design clamping tailfin holder with M2 screws/nuts and PETG

- [ ] design some kind of locking mechanism for the pod case

- [ ] re-design control horns (surface mount instead of thru-hole)
- [ ] redesign control surfaces on tailfin
- [ ] add hole to pod template for top and for receiver antenna
- [ ] change nut sizes in pod to M2
- [ ] remove material from center of wings, make hole for servo cables smaller

#### Weight savings
- [ ] switch to M2
- [ ] switch servos to SG90 instead of MG90S
- [ ] print non-structural parts out of air pla
- [ ] ELRS mini receiver
- [ ] 2S 220mAh battery

#### Re-print with new designs
- [ ] figure out LW-PLA
- [ ] re-print pod in LW-PLA
- [ ] re-print tailfin adapter with LW PLA

#### Redo Plane
- [ ] remake tailfin assembly
- [ ] redo control rod setup

# PROTOTYPE COMPLETE AND READY TO FLY

### Design Fairings
- [ ] front cover
- [ ] rear cover

### Make a New one and give it away

Questions:
- how long did it take to make?
- how many materials did it require?

### Template Updates
- [ ] update wing CAD file
    - [ ] attach fairing 14" down wing, 5mm away from leading edge
    - [ ] 7" piano wire length, 70mm actuation distance
    - [ ] 10x20mm hole in the wing next to the fairing
- [ ] is servo direction going to end up mattering? (probably, yes)
- [ ] design left and right wing fairings differently

- [ ] update all templates with control surface locations and other things
- [ ] combine all templates into printable pdfs
    - [ ] wings
    - [ ] horizontal stabilizer
    - [ ] vertical stabilizer
    - [ ] wing spars
    - [ ] pod
    - [ ] pod spars
    - [ ] payload insert

### 3D CAD Updates
- [ ] clean up all the CAD files

- [ ] update design documents
- [ ] add obsidian notes to design docs

### Engineering Docs
- [ ] interface control document
- [ ] power budget
- [ ] mass growth allowance
- [ ] TRL assessment
- [ ] iterate
