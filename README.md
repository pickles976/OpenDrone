# OpenDrone

Open Drone is my attempt at creating a cheap, modular, easy-to-build and easy-to-fly fixed-wing FPV drone. 

As a total beginner, I am learning as I go and prioritizing simplicity at every step. I try to avoid complex/skilled construction tricks.

I will try to make drones in different "weight" categories, starting with the [Mockingbird](./Mockingbird/README.md).

The goal is to have a collection of simple and cheap open-source drone designs with flight characteristics that make them useful tools, and not just toys. Long flight times, large payloads, modularity, and field-repairability are all design goals. The goal is to allow small groups of people to mass produce SAR drones without needing a whole lot of capital. A single maker or tinkerer with a should be able to assemble a small fleet of drones in their garage with a 3D printer, some hand tools, and [Made in China](https://evcraft.en.made-in-china.com) account.
