# TODO

1. Electronics Pod
2. Motor Mount
3. Servo Mount
4. Upper attachment thing
5. Fairings

### CAD
- [x] create servo mount
- [x] create Motor mount attachment
- [x] create servo mount v2
- [x] design tailfin assembly
- [x] print tailfin assembly
- [x] rework servo mount and electronics payload to have snap-fit parts

- [x] re-design tailfin assembly again
- [x] print servo mounts

- [x] redesign tailfin assembly. Make it 3 parts. One part should just glue to the stabilizer, and two parts to reinforce the tailfin

- [x] print e-payload
- [x] print tailfin assembly, print flysky mount

- [ ] assemble everything
- [ ] hook up control surfaces
    - [ ] print control horns
    - [ ] design wire guides for tailfin controls (goes over CF rod and guides the piano wires)
- [ ] test

- [ ] design pod foam template
- [ ] design some kind of locking mechanism

- [ ] assemble and test!

# PROTOTYPE COMPLETE

### Design Fairings
- [ ] front cover
- [ ] rear cover

- [ ] cable situtation inside???

### Template Updates
- [ ] update wing CAD file
    - [ ] attach fairing 14" down wing, 5mm away from leading edge
    - [ ] 7" piano wire length, 70mm actuation distance
    - [ ] 10x20mm hole in the wing next to the fairing
- [ ] is servo direction going to end up mattering? (probably, yes)
- [ ] design left and right wing fairings differently

- [ ] update all templates with control surface locations and other things
- [ ] combine all templates into printable pdfs
    - [ ] wings
    - [ ] horizontal stabilizer
    - [ ] vertical stabilizer
    - [ ] wing spars
    - [ ] pod
    - [ ] pod spars
    - [ ] payload insert

### 3D CAD Updates
- [ ] clean up all the CAD files

- [ ] update design documents
- [ ] add obsidian notes to design docs

### Engineering Docs
- [ ] interface control document
- [ ] power budget
- [ ] mass growth allowance
- [ ] TRL assessment
- [ ] iterate
